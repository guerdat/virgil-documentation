# Important Notes for Querying

## Current AEs
When referring to "current AEs", this means owners with email addresses matthewv@usehatchapp.com, nicholas.wood@usehatchapp.com, and alex.marshall@usehatchapp.com.

## Won Deals
A deal is considered 'won' if the property_hs_closed_won_date is not NULL.

## Identifying Usage or Overage Revenue
When querying the customer_recurring_revenue table, you can identify "usage" or "overage" revenue by using the following filter:
   ```sql
   WHERE lower(product_name) LIKE '%bot%'
      OR lower(product_name) LIKE '%sms%'
      OR lower(product_name) LIKE '%ai conversations%'
      OR lower(product_name) LIKE '%mms%'
      OR lower(product_name) LIKE '%usage%'
   ```

   Only exclude this revenue if explicitly told to do so
   
## Monthly Queries
When querying the customer_recurring_revenue table on a monthly basis, use the filter 'WHERE dt = month_end_date' to summing across daily snapshots.

## SQOs
A deal is considered a "Sales Qualified Opportunity" (SQO) if it has entered the deal_stage with value '145109412'.

## SQL Dialect Notes
DuckDB does not support using the window function row_number() in the WHERE clause. When writing queries for DuckDB, avoid filtering directly on window functions in the WHERE clause and instead use subqueries or CTEs to materialize the window function results first.

## Vehicle Performance Tracking
The engine_log table contains 105 columns covering engine performance, GPS, and vehicle dynamics data. Most columns are of DOUBLE type, with file_date being the only VARCHAR column.

The table tracks detailed engine metrics including RPM, MAP, Boost PSI, TPS, AFR, and various fuel corrections. It also includes spark-related columns tracking spark advance, retard, and correction factors.

For location tracking, the table captures GPS and location data including latitude, longitude, heading, and accuracy. Performance metrics include Zero to 60 Time, Power, Torque, and various force measurements.

The engine_log table contains multiple log files. The 'time' column represents elapsed time in seconds since the beginning of the log and is not guaranteed to be unique. The 'file_date' column stores the date and time of the log file in 'YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS' format.

Data in the engine_log table is generated from a four cylinder, four stroke gasoline 1608cc engine. This engine has fuel injectors that flow approximately 17.1 lb/hr. The computer producing the logs is a microsquirt ECU.

The vehicle uses a 5 speed manual transmission that drives the rear wheels through a 3.91:1 ratio differential.

The vehicle is equipped with 185/60 R 14 tires.

The stoic target for this engine is 14.7, which represents the ideal air-fuel ratio for optimal combustion efficiency.

## Database Changes
All six Hubspot-related tables (hubspot.deal, hubspot.deal_stage, hubspot.owner, hubspot.users, hubspot.deal_company, hubspot.company) have been dropped from the database.
